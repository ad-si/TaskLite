# Installation

Check out the following pages for instructions
on how to install the different versions of TaskLite.


## Updating

When you update to a newer version of TaskLite,
all your data will automatically migrated to the latest version.
This also works if you skip a few releases.

Nevertheless, it's highly recommended to run `tasklite backup`
before installing a new version.

Also be aware that rollbacks are currently not supported.
