# Repetition and Recurrence

The difference between repetition and recurrence is the reference point from
which future tasks are calculated from.

For repetition, it's the closing datetime.
E.g. if a task gets completed,
a duplicate will be created with the specified time offset added to
the closing datetime.
Check out the "Mow the law" example below for more details.

Recurring tasks are tasks which need to be done every day, week, etc. and
must not be delayed.
I.e. missed completions must be caught up immediately.
Check out the "Pay the rent" example below for more details.

A task is either recurring or repeating, but can't be both at the same time.
For both repetition and recurrence series, only the currently active task
exists and subsequent tasks will be created on demand,
once the current task is closed.
